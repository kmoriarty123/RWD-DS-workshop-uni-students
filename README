Using the synthetic dataset from CMS, U.S. insurance claims data, the objective was to answer the following: in patients with coronary artery disease, what are the differences in long-term outcomes, including survival rates, cardiovascular events, and quality of life, between those who undergo angioplasty and those who undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)?

This exploration is meant for introducing RWD to students.
